Demo App of Sign In With Apple on iOS13 and lower

## Overview

This sample app uses the [AuthenticationServices][1] framework to provide users an interface to set up accounts and sign in with their Apple ID. The app presents a form in which the user can create and set up an account for the app, then authenticates the user’s Apple ID with Sign in with Apple, and displays the user’s account data.
